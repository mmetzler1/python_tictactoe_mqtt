TicTacToe Robot Game
Hello everyone,
we students and teachers of the Friedrich-Ebert-Schule in Esslingen, 
have put together a project in cooperation with the Hadarim High School.
This project was about programming a TicTacToe game with our partner school in Israel. 
The moves should be forwarded to a robot and carried out.
We started programming Python at the beginning of the school year. 
After learning Python basics like variables, conditions and loops, we learned drawing with Python. 
Then we went on to create lists and output information. We have received several 
exercises from our teacher. Next we started programming our TicTacToe game. 
It took us for programming from Christmas to the end of our school year. 
The difficult thing for us was that we only had 1 Â½ hours a week and some of us did not always come along. In addition, we students worked with Python at different speeds. There were students who got along faster with Python and some it took longer to learn.
The game is designed, that it can be played with each other over the Internet. 
In the beginning, the idea was that we from the Friedrich Ebert School should 
play with our partner school in Israel. Unfortunately, this didn't happen because of Corona (COVID-19). 
The program works with MQTT messages, so we send MQTT messages to each other.
The robot evaluates also the MQTT message and moves the stones. We designed,  
constructed and created stones and game board with Inventor.
The first samples we created with a 3D printer.
Afterwards we manufactured the board and the stones in the workshop.
The first priority was fun and we had plenty of it.

Best regards
Students and teachers of the Friedrich-Ebert-Schule
